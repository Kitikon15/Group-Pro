# AI Prototyping Features

## Overview
AI Prototyping enables rapid creation of functional prototypes directly from specifications or descriptions using AI technologies.

## Core Components

### 1. Prototype Generator
Transforms specifications into working prototypes with:
- Basic UI components
- Functional backend logic
- Sample data
- Initial styling

### 2. Interactive Prototyping Interface
A web-based interface where users can:
- Describe features in natural language
- See AI-generated prototypes in real-time
- Modify and refine prototypes
- Export prototypes for further development

### 3. Component Library
Pre-built components that can be assembled into prototypes:
- Forms and inputs
- Navigation elements
- Data display components
- Interactive elements

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Prototype Generation
- Text-to-UI conversion
- Simple component generation
- Basic styling application

### Phase 2: Interactive Refinement
- Real-time prototype modification
- Component customization
- Style adjustment tools

### Phase 3: Export and Integration
- Export to Laravel Blade templates
- Integration with existing codebase
- Version control for prototypes

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Laravel)
```
app/
  Http/
    Controllers/
      Ai/
        PrototypeController.php
  Ai/
    PrototypeGenerator.php
    ComponentLibrary.php
    StyleEngine.php
routes/
  ai.php
```

### Frontend
- Vue.js or React-based prototype editor
- Real-time preview pane
- Component palette
- Property editors

## API Endpoints

### Generate Prototype
```
POST /api/ai/prototype/generate
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "specification": "Create a user dashboard with profile information, recent activity feed, and settings panel",
  "style": "modern",
  "components": ["card", "list", "button"]
}
```

### Refine Prototype
```
POST /api/ai/prototype/refine
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "prototype_id": "abc123",
  "modifications": [
    {
      "component": "profile-card",
      "changes": {
        "style": "add-shadow",
        "position": "top-right"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Database
- New `ai_prototypes` table to store generated prototypes
- Relationship with users and projects
- Version history for prototypes

### Views
- New Blade templates for prototype display
- Admin interface for prototype management
- Public preview pages

## Usage Workflow

1. **Specification Input**
   - User describes desired feature/prototype
   - AI processes specification

2. **Prototype Generation**
   - AI generates basic prototype
   - Applies default styling
   - Creates necessary components

3. **Review and Refinement**
   - User reviews generated prototype
   - Makes adjustments through interface
   - AI refines based on feedback

4. **Export and Implementation**
   - Export prototype as Laravel components
   - Integrate with existing application
   - Continue manual development

## Benefits
- Rapid prototyping without manual coding
- Consistent design patterns
- Easy iteration and refinement
- Reduced time from concept to implementation
- Better stakeholder alignment through visual prototypes
