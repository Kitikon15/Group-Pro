# Spec Driven Development (SDD) Implementation Guide

## Overview
Spec Driven Development is a methodology where development begins with detailed specifications before any coding begins. This approach ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of requirements and expected outcomes.

## Implementation in WEB-NPRU Project

### 1. Specification Creation
- All features must have a detailed specification document before development begins
- Specifications should include:
  - Feature overview and objectives
  - User stories and acceptance criteria
  - Technical requirements
  - Mockups or design references
  - Success metrics and validation criteria

### 2. Specification Review Process
- All specifications must be reviewed by:
  - Project stakeholders
  - Development team
  - QA team
  - UX/UI designers (when applicable)

### 3. Development Process
- Development begins only after specification approval
- Code must align exactly with the specification
- Any deviations must be documented and approved

### 4. Testing Approach
- Test cases are created based on specifications
- Automated testing validates that implementation matches specifications
- Manual testing for UX validation

### 5. Documentation
- All specifications are maintained in the `docs/specs/` directory
- Version control for specification changes
- Traceability between specifications and implemented features

## Benefits
- Reduced rework due to misunderstandings
- Clear expectations for all stakeholders
- Easier onboarding for new team members
- Better quality assurance
- Improved project estimation
